## Functions

The MetaID issuer backend provides the following functions:

- `issue/id`: This function issues nouns using a custom 721 contract called MetaID721. It generates and assigns unique nouns to individuals.
- `issue/cert`: This function issues Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) tokens using a custom 1155 contract called MetaCert. It enables the issuance of tokens to individuals as proof of their attendance.
- `nft/:id`: The backend provides APIs for `tokenUri` that allow the retrieval of metadata associated with the issued tokens.
- `addtest`: This function enables the addition of new certificates generated by AI tests. The certificates can be added through the waterloo-test-server.
